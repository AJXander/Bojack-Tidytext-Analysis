# Bojack-Tidytext-Analysis


The purpose of this project is to complete a text analysis of the subtitle files for the series Bojack Horseman.
>
The initial inspiration was the <a href = "https://www.tidytextmining.com">Tidy Text Mining</a> package and the associated course on Datacamp.
In addition to this, an intense course with Eduardo Ari√±o de la Rubia on Unstructured Text Analysis gave further inspiration
Finally, the processing of subtitle files was inspired by <a href="http://tamaszilagyi.com/blog/a-tidy-text-analysis-of-rick-and-morty/">Tamas Szilyagi</a>.

The first steps will be a basic aggregation of text data, and summary statistics including a TF-IDF analysis of the show and by series.

As a further challenge, I will transcribe the conversations and identify speakers and listeners in order to evaluate character interactions and dynamics over the course of the series.
